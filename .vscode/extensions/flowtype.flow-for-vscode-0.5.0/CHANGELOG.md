### Master

### 0.5.0

* Uses the absolute path to the `where` command provided by Windows - JPanneel #69
* Uses the new VS Code autocompletion API for functions - orta #51
* When you want to work on the flow-for-vscode project, pressing run will start the
  babel build watcher task - orta
* Adds support for *.js.flow files ( such as those generated by graphql-js ) which are 
  treated as common JavaScript files - orta
* Fixes "File not found" error with diagnostics when `flow status --json` provides
  non-absolute file paths - ryanashcraft #77

### 0.4.0

* Adds the ability to use flow from your project's node_modules folder. 
  This is a security risk ( see https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/570) and so it
  is hidden behind a user setting of `useNPMPackagedFlow` which needs to be set to `true`
  for it to work. - orta #53
* Show flow errors that start at line 0 - orta #54
