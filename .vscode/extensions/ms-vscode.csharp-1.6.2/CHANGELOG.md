## 1.5.0 (November 14, 2016)

#### Initial support for C# 7

* New C# 7 features like pattern-matching and tuples are now supported in VS Code editor. Note: To use tuples, you will need a reference to [this NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.ValueTuple).

#### Initial support for CSProj .NET Core Projects

* With the .NET Core SDK moving to embrace MSBuild and .csproj files over project.json, we've made sure the C# extension can handle the new format. This support is preliminary and there are still several features coming to smooth out the experience.

#### Broader OS Support for C# Code Editing

* This release dramatically changes the runtime that OmniSharp runs on, which allows it to be run an many more operating systems than before:

  * Windows: OmniSharp runs on the installed .NET Framework. In addition, OmniSharp now runs on 32-bit Windows!
  * macOS/Linux: OmniSharp runs on a custom embedded Mono runtime. Note: Mono does not need to be installed on the system for this to work.

#### Debugger

* Remote debugging is now supported for attach by using the `pipeTransport` launch.json option.
* Resolved issue with setting breakpoints when there are multple files with the same name (e.g. two 'Program.cs' files).

#### New Dependency Acquisition System

* This improves the acquisition and reliability of platform-specific OmniSharp and debugger dependencies.

#### New Settings

Several new settings have been added:

* `csharp.suppressDotnetRestoreNotification`: Suppress the notification window to perform a 'dotnet restore' when dependencies can't be resolved.
* `omnisharp.projectLoadTimeout`: The time Visual Studio Code will wait for the OmniSharp server to start. Time is expressed in seconds. _(Contributed by [@wjk](https://github.com/wjk))_

#### Colorizer

* A new unit testing framework for testing the colorizer grammer ([#742](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/742)) _(Contributed by [@ivanz](https://github.com/ivanz))_
* Single-line comments after preprocessor directives ([#762](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/762)) _(Contributed by [@damieng](https://github.com/damieng))_

#### Performance

* Major improvements have been made to editor performance. The communication with the OmniSharp server has been rewritten to allow long-running operations (such as gathering all errors and warnings) to queue while high priority operations (such as text buffer changes) run serially. ([#902](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/902)) _(Thanks to [@david-driscoll](https://github.com/david-driscoll) for his help with this change!)_ 

#### Other Improvements

* The prompt to generate assets for building and debugging can now be dismissed for a workspace permanently. In addition, a new `dotnet.generateAssets` command has been added to force regeneration of the assets. ([#635](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/635))
* Fix "running forever" issue for folder with multple .NET Core projects. ([#735](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/735)) _(Contributed by [@eamodio](https://github.com/eamodio))_
* `ctor` snippet is now more consistent with other code snippets. ([#849](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/849)) _(Contibuted by [@Eibx](https://github.com/Eibx))_
* Ampersands in file paths are now properly escaped on Windows ([#909](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/pull/909)) _(Contributed by [@filipw](https://github.com/filipw))_

## 1.4.1 (September 1, 2016)

* This addresses an issue found and fixed by @sixpindin in which the legacy csharp.omnisharp and csharp.omnisharpUsesMono settings are no longer respected. These settings have been supplanted by the omnisharp.path and omnisharp.useMono settings but are still expected to work if specified.

## 1.4.0 (August 29, 2016)

#### Metadata as Source

* Go to Definition (<kbd>F12</kbd>) can now show a C#-like view for APIs that do not appear in your project's source code. ([#165](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/165))

#### Debugger

* Applications can now be launched without attaching the debugger with <kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>.
* Support for new "embedded portable PDB" debug format.
* The launch.json file generator now automatically sets the option to show a console window by default (`"internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart"`).

#### New Settings

Several new settings have been added:

* `csharp.suppressDotnetInstallWarning`: Suppress the warning that the .NET CLI is not on the path.
* `omnisharp.autoStart`: Used to control whether the OmniSharp server will be automatically launched when a folder containing a project or solution is opened. The default value for this setting is `true`.
* `omnisharp.path`: Can be used to specify a file path to a different OmniSharp server than the one that will be used by default. Previously, this option was controlled by `csharp.omnisharp`, which is now deprecated.
* `omnisharp.useMono`: When `omnisharp.path` is specified, this controls whether OmniSharp will be launched with Mono or not. Previously, this option was controlled by `csharp.omnisharpUsesMono`, wich is now deprecated.
* `omnisharp.loggingLevel`: Used to control the level of logging output from the OmniSharp server. Legal values are `"default"` or `"verbose"`.

#### Colorizer

There have been several fixes to the colorizer grammar resulting in much smoother syntax highlighting, with better support for C# 6.0. Special thanks go to [@ivanz](https://github.com/ivanz) and [@seraku24](https://github.com/seraku24) for contributing most of the fixes below!

* Expression-bodied members ([#638](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/638), [#403](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/403), [#679](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/679), [#249](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/249))
* Escaped keyword identifiers ([#614](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/614))
* Using directives and nested namespaces ([#282](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/282), [#381](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/381))
* Field and local variable type names ([#717](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/717), [#719](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/719))
* Multi-dimensional arrays in parameters ([#657](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/657))

#### Performance

* Improvements have been made in processing diagnostics (i.e. errors and warnings).
* Full solution diagnostics are no longer computed for large solutions (e.g. solutions with >1000 files across all projects). However, diagnostics are still computed for open files.

#### Other Improvements

* Multibyte characters are now properly encoded, resulting in proper display in tooltips and fixing crashes in the OmniSharp server. ([#4](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/4), [#140](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/140), [#427](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/427))
* Will no longer attempt to install a CoreCLR flavor of OmniSharp on Ubuntu versions other than 14 and 16. ([#655](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/655))
* Opening a solution or csproj no longer results in '0 projects' displayed in the status bar. ([#723](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/723))

## 1.3.0 (July 20, 2016)

* Support for Unity and Mono development on macOS and Linux has been restored! This release brings back support for the Mono version of OmniSharp, which is used to provide *much* better support for .csproj/.sln projects. Please note that Mono version 4.0.1 or newer is required.
* Generation of tasks.json and launch.json files can now properly handle nested projects. [#170](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/170)
* New UI that makes it easy to select a process ID when attaching the debugger to another process. Note: If you have an existing launch.json file, you can re-generate it by deleting the file, closing your workspace in Visual Studio Code and opening it again. Or, you can open the launch.json file and change the `processId` value to `"${command.pickProcess}"`.
* Support for debugging in .cshtml files. To enable this, add a `sourceFileMap` entry to your launch.json with the following content: `"sourceFileMap": { "/Views": "${workspaceRoot}/Views" }`
* Support for conditional breakpoints
* New support for changing variable values in the debugger! To try this, just right-click on the variable name and select 'Set Value'. Note: To properly support this feature, we've changed the display of variable type names in the debugger to a shortened form. The full type name can be viewed by hovering over the name with the mouse.
* New configuration option to enable [stepping into properties and operators](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/release/debugger.md#stepping-into-properties-and-operators).
* Duplicate warnings and errors should no longer accumulate in Unity projects [#447](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/447)

## 1.2.0 (June 29, 2016)

* Adds debugger support for new Linux versions: Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora 23, openSUSE 13.2, and Oracle Linux 7.1
* Enhanced debug console output: module loads are now output, and there are launch.json options for controlling what is output
* Source file checksum support for breakpoints. This ensures that the debugger only sets breakpoints in code that exactly matches the open document.
* Support for editing the value of variables in the watch and locals window (requires VS Code 1.3)
